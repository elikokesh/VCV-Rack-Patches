# VCV-Rack-Patches

Welcome to my research project!

This github contains many (somewhat) organized patches within VCV Rack 2.0. These patches hopefully will help in demonstrating some of the fundamental concepts of modular synthesis and sound design in general

Before opening any make sure to check the 'Module Master List' and subscribe to the libraries I've listed there. Some of the modules are rarely used, but I think its a decent set of modules to explore anyway.

I have left relatively detailed notes inside the patches on VCV Rack's Notes module. They should do a decent job at explaining my thought process and the cable coding system I employed when creating these patches (although they are character capped). I will try and record some explanatory videos and upload those here as well as on youtube, however those are still an idea at this point. 

More than a few of the patches will be a better experience with a MIDI Keyboard to connect into VCV Rack, so I reccommend using one whenever the MIDI module is used in the patch. (However if you don't have one you can always use a sequencer for programming V/Oct)

If you have any questions about this project feel free to reach out and ask! You can find me on instagram @elikokesh (I'm usually quick at responding).

Hopefully this will be a useful resourse for you during your modular exploration :)
